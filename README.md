# DRC MPXV Genomic Surveillance

## Contents
This folder contains mpxv genomes from the genomic surveillance programme in DRC

- A ZIP archive containing 414 currently unpublished genomes:

    `inrb_mpxv_drc_unpublished.fasta.zip` 

- A ZIP archive containing 409 genomes that have been submitted to NCBI Genbank:

    `inrb_mpxv_drc_genbank.fasta.zip`

- A single CSV containing metadata fields:

    `inrb_mpxv_drc.csv`

The FASTA headers contain the following fields:

    `<accession>|<lab_id>|<country>|<province>|<collection_date>`

## Use of data
We are making these genomes available to assist public health response to the mpox emergency. We are publicly sharing the data with the following restrictions and requests:

1. We ask that the unpublished genomes are not used in research publications without prior discussion with the data producers.
2. The genomes that are available on NCBI Genbank _can_ be used in publications but strictly as background to put other genomes in context. They are part of on-going research projects and we will be publishing additional studies on them in the context of the DRC so we ask that before undertaking research focused on these data, researchers contact us to discuss their plans.
3. We also ask that any publication cites the papers where the data was first published, and where possible acknowledges the teams that produced the data.
